## Welcome to my website!

My experience with programming started with my research assistant roles in Psychological labs in college, and working as a data analyst in the industry. I have been using SAS, R and python data analysis tools to tackling with different types of data. Python’s capability for data analysis and infinite programming possibilities fascinated me. Motivated by a desire to apply my analytical skills in a more challenging environment, I made the shift into software development.

After a couple months of practicing Python and JavaScript through Online Courses (Coursera, Udacity, Edx etc.), I applied and got accepted to an immersive software engineering program, with a <8% acceptance rate focusing on full stack JavaScript web development using the NERD stack (Node.js, Express.js, React.js and the database ORM Sequelize). I got hand on experience on developing various programs from front end to back end, from unit testing to code review.

As my programing skills developed, I felt a strong need to learn the fundamental concept and theories of Computer Science. After the Grace Hopper program, I enrolled as a Computer Science Master’s student at Georgia Institute of Technology (its Computer Science graduate program was ranked top 10) to deepen my knowledge of computer science.
