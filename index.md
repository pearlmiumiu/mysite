## Welcome to my website!
I am an Data Analyst from New Jersey. I love finding interesting and meaningful patterns from large and complex datasets.


### A little bit about myself

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```
